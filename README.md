# Site Goals
- social media site where users can post things to a global board, and also to private boards(friends only, groups, etc.)
- real time chat with sockets.io
# Tech Used
- React, Express, MongoDB
# Setup
$ npm install

$ npm run client-install

create an .env file at root with the following (to access database):

MONGO_URI="//contributor:password1@ds229878.mlab.com:29878/social-media"


to start Express server:
$ npm run server

to start React server:
$ npm run client  

to start both servers:
$ npm run dev


to connect to mongo shell in terminal:
$ mongo ds229878.mlab.com:29878/social-media -u contributor -p password1
$ db.users.find() 

# Current Goal:
- Build a basic site, with users able to create posts and see all posts.

# ToDos:
- Create Nav-bar to go to below pages
Routes/Pages to create in React, with endpoints in Express API to fetch info:
- Main Page('/'): All posts are shown. Text for now(like Twitter), later enable other content/pics/vids/etc.(like reddit).
- User Page('/user'): Should show user's posts, with options to edit/delete.
- Account Page('/settings'): Should show user info(email, name), and options to edit/delete account

# Done So Far
- Connected React
- Connected MongoDB
- Set Up User Auth in Express with JWT and Passport
- Set Up User Authentication in React side
  - login/signup/logout forms working
  - stores token in local storage and include in header
  - fetches user on app mount if local storage has token

# To Consider
-production build should run one server
